I focus on learning by **building**, not just using tools.  
Most of my work is around:

- Low-level programming in **C / C++**
- System concepts: processes, memory, file descriptors
- Networking: sockets, HTTP, web servers
- Writing parsers, engines, and tools from zero (42-style)

📌 *My goal is to master the fundamentals of software engineering and systems programming, and to become an engineer who truly understands what happens behind the screen.*
