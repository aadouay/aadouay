# Hey, I'm Ayoub Adouay 👋

> _Student at **1337 Coding School (42 Network)**_  
> _Low-level enthusiast. Systems-minded. Builder by nature._

I’m passionate about understanding **how things really work** —  
from memory and processes to networks and web servers.

I don’t just use tools.  
I **build them**.

---

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- Low-level programming in **C / C++**
- Core system concepts:  
  processes, memory, file descriptors
- Networking fundamentals:  
  sockets, HTTP, custom web servers
- Writing parsers, engines, and tools from scratch (42-style)

My way of learning is simple:

> **Build first. Understand deeply. Optimize later.**
